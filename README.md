# AI-Powered Agentic Workflow for Project Management

In this repo, you will find all the files about a developed AI-Powered Agentic Workflow for Project Management

The developed system showcases a mature and technically robust approach to multi-agent orchestration, workflow automation, and LLM-driven project planning. At its core is a well-architected agentic_workflow.py module that coordinates agents, structures their interactions, and ensures seamless execution from initial planning to final evaluation.

The workflow demonstrates true end-to-end capability: it autonomously generates action plans, transforms them into structured user stories and feature sets, decomposes them into implementation tasks, and then evaluates the results with clear, auditable logic. The outputs follow strict formatting and structural standards, making them easy to review, trace, and integrate into downstream processes.

The codebase reflects strong engineering discipline, with clean modular boundaries, well-defined agent responsibilities, and thoughtful orchestration flows. It adheres to best practices in prompt engineering, API interaction, and data modeling, resulting in a system that is both reliable and extensible. Overall, the work represents a professional-grade implementation of an agentic workflow framework, balancing clarity, automation, and technical precision.
